# Reporting bugs and feature requests

[Issues](https://github.com/helge17/tuxguitar/issues) are used for bug reports and feature requests. Before creating a new issue, do a quick search to make sure it does not already exist.
Your work is not over once you have created an issue: stay tuned and check the issue's status regularly, we may have questions for you that need answered before a fix can be implemented.

## Bug reports

Before reporting a bug, it's better if you can check it is still reproducible with latest [pre-release](https://github.com/helge17/tuxguitar/releases).

Many bugs are configuration-dependent, so make sure to include the following information in the issue's description:

- the **version** of the app, e.g. "2025-08-23-master", or "1.6.6" (see menu Help/About);
- if it's a pre-release of desktop app, the variant: **SWT** or **JFX**;
- the **operating system** and its **version**, e.g. "Windows 11", or "Ubuntu 24.04";
- the detailed **sequence of actions** leading to the bug;
- a description of both the **observed** and the **expected** behaviors.

Don't hesitate to include screenshots or short videos to help understand. If the bug occurs for one specific tablature file, please attach it as a zipped file in the issue's description.
Basically: all information enabling us to reproduce the issue is welcome.

## Feature requests

A feature you would love is currently missing? You can create a dedicated [issue](https://github.com/helge17/tuxguitar/issues).
Use **"Feature request"** in the issue's description, and try to provide a precise description of your desired feature.
Please remember that this project is maintained by volunteers only, so some requests may not be implemented and most will take time. Be patient and polite when making or responding to requests.
