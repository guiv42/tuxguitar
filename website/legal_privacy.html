# Privacy policy

This website only stores the usage data described below. No other data is collected. In particular, the website does not use any analysis tools and does not integrate any external content.

This website does not use cookies. The operator is therefore unable to track who has accessed which data. So no user profiles can be created.

## Usage data

Each time a web page is accessed, data about this process is collected and used only for the duration of the process to provide the content. The IP address is not stored past the end of the user session.

Each time you access one of the pages or retrieve a file, the following data is also collected and stored in a log file:

- the date and time of the request,
- the name of the retrieved file,
- the access status (file transferred successfully, file not found, etc.),
- the amount of data transferred,
- the page from which the file was requested (referrer),
- a description of the web browser used.

Since the retrieving IP address is not stored, the data in the log file is not personal. The data is not passed on to third parties, even in excerpts.

## Contact

If you have any questions about data processing on this website, please contact me at the e-mail address given above.
